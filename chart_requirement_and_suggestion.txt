DIY Data Viz

(Do It Yourself Data Visualization)

Background

In this project you use Python code to create an illustration, or visualization of some data you collect. This can be just an XY chart, or a bar chart, but can be whatever creative way you choose to portray the trends in the data you collect. If you would like to do some sort of fancier approach, please feel free to do so. This is sometimes called an "infographic" and you see them on-line, on TV and in publications.
_______________dùng code python để tạo 1 minh họa (hoặc biểu diễn trực quan hóa) cho 1 vài dữ liệu bạn tự thu thập, đó có thể là 1 biểu đồ XY, hoặc 1 biểu đồ cột, bất cứ cái gì gì_______________________
What sort of data? Pick something that will hold your interest. Here are some ideas but you are not limited to my suggestions as long as you follow the guidelines below:

Pick something you can quantify. This means something you can count or something you can measure. Examples include but are certainly not limited to:
_______________một số gợi ý cho dữ liệu sẽ thu thập: ... bất cứ cái gì có thể đếm hoặc đo_______________________
The number of cars, trucks and SUVs of particular makes, models or colors in a campus or shđoopping center parking lot over time (slide through time?)
How many of a particular fashion style you can count in some public place in a 15 minute period. (Again, with some selection of place or time from among several choices). 
Numbers and styles of beards and mustaches sited during the day.
Number of books in several different genres (e.g. Computer, Mystery, Teen Paranormal Romance, Cooking) found on the shelves of a local Barnes and Noble or Books a Million, etc.
Sizes (length, height, weight) of my or my friends' pets.
Total number of minutes in commercials in 2 hours of TV programming, perhaps for local (Over The Air, say Channel 9) channels versus a cable-only channel (say Discovery). Or break down several more hours of TV into commercial "genres", e.g Vehicles, Medical, Lawyer, Sports Promo, etc.
Scrape some data from the web (perhaps using Python) and display it via an update-able p3js canvas.
Personal Fitness data -- how many hours of exercise, how many crunches (ugh) or whatever you or your friends do in a week or so.
The idea is to measure something that answers a question in which you are interested, and then display those measurements in a creative, visual way. You are not restricted at all to my ideas above – come up with your own.

Guidelines

You must have at least three categories and you must collect at least 30 data points. There should be at least one count or measurement in every category, in other words, no completely empty categories.

You must post a brief description of what you will collect in the  discussion thread set up for this purpose. I will make suggestions as needed.

After you collect your data, you must post your categories and numbers as a reply to your initial post.
_______________dữ liệu phải có ít nhất 3 nhãn, ít nhất 30 điểm dữ liệu, cần có ít nhất 1 thang để đo/ đếm trong mỗi nhãn, nói cách khác, không được nhãn nào hoàn toàn rỗng (không có điểm dữ liệu nào), phải có đoạn mô tả ngắn về dữ liệu đã thu thập, phải đăng lên các nhãn và số liệu ở đầu bài đăng trước khi thu thập_______________________
You must create some sort of visual display of your data using Python and any other JS or html/css code you write and run.  Relevant Python modules here are Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and others.  Google for examples, that will help.

If there are pictures that help you make your point, then please use them. You may use pictures from the web, or pictures you take, (as long as they do not show anyone's face, and fall within the bounds of conventionally-accepted good taste).

All images and subjects must fall into the conventionally understood bounds of "good taste". Enough said. I would also avoid politics and religion if at all possible, particularly in the current times.

Visualizing your Data

I am hopeful for some really creative ideas here, but as a start, here are a couple of suggestions. You must follow the guidelines, but you do not have to follow my ideas for visualization – come up with your own if you like.

At a minimum, your chart or infographic must contain all of the categories for which you collected data, and a viewer should be able to learn something interesting about the categories or their comparison from looking at the output of your program.

Some ideas:

A simple "word cloud" where the size of a word, say "Toyota" relates to the number of that brand of vehicles you observed. Arrange the words on your canvas however you like. As you probably know from this point in the class, you can use the text( ) and related methods here. Have something interesting happen when you click on a word. 

A bar chart using pictures, where the height, width or area of the picture shows the quantity of your observations in a particular category. The pictures must symbolize your categories in an understandable way. Let the user interact and explore the chart in some interesting way. (Say mouse-clicks)

Find a way to use color to make your points. In addition to rgb (Red, Green and Blue), p3js has a color model called HSB (Hue, Saturation and Brightness) that let's you use a single number to pick out a shade along the rainbow, with lower numbers showing as red, intermediate numbers as green, and higher numbers as blue or purple.  This is handy when you want to show values of some quantity as shades of "hotness".

If you can, add some element of interactivity – is there something that could happen when you click the mouse on an element of the infographic that would reveal additional information or insight? (pop-up a text "factoid" or another pic).

This sounds like a fun and creative project! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
_______________gợi ý các bước để làm_______________________

1. Choose Your Data Collection Topic_______________lựa chọn dữ liệu sẽ làm việc với nó_______________________
Pick a topic that you’re interested in and can easily collect data for. Here are some examples:

Car types in a parking lot: Count the number of sedans, SUVs, and trucks over different times or days.
Types of outfits in a public place: Track different clothing styles (casual, formal, sporty).
Personal fitness data: Track exercise time, calories burned, and steps taken over a week.
2. Collect Your Data
_______________thu thập dữ liệu, phải có ít nhất 3 nhãn và 30 điểm dữ liệu, lưu lại dữ liệu ở dạng nào đó, chẳng hạn như bảng hoặc (google)sheet_______________________
You need at least three categories and 30 data points. For example, if you’re counting car types, you could have categories like "SUVs," "Sedans," and "Trucks," and count the number of each across different days.

Record your data in a structured format like a table or spreadsheet for easy reference later.

3. Choose a Visualization Method
_______________lựa chọn cách để thể hiện dữ liệu, một số lựa chọn là biểu đồ thanh, biểu đồ đường, biểu đồ tròn hoặc mô phỏng dạng đám mây (https://rpubs.com/tranquangquy_ictu/774601)_______________________
You can get creative with how you display your data. Here are a few visualization types and how you could implement them:

Bar chart: Compare quantities across categories.
Pie chart: Show proportions of each category.
Line chart: Visualize trends over time.
Word cloud: Visualize words' frequency.
4. Use Python Libraries for Visualization
_______________code python, bắt đầu với Matplotlib để vẽ biểu đồ, code Seaborn trên nền Matplotlib, và thư viện Plotly cho phép tương tác với biểu đồ _______________________
Matplotlib: Great for basic bar, pie, and line charts.
Seaborn: Built on Matplotlib, it’s more powerful for complex visualizations.
Plotly: Allows for interactive charts, which could make your project more engaging.

Example: Simple Bar Chart Using Matplotlib
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data (replace with your data)
categories = ['SUVs', 'Sedans', 'Trucks']
values = [15, 10, 5]  # Number of cars counted in each category

plt.bar(categories, values, color=['blue', 'green', 'red'])
plt.xlabel('Car Type')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Car Types in Parking Lot')

plt.show()
Example: Simple Pie Chart Using Matplotlib
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
categories = ['SUVs', 'Sedans', 'Trucks']
values = [15, 10, 5]

plt.pie(values, labels=categories, autopct='%1.1f%%', colors=['blue', 'green', 'red'])
plt.title('Proportion of Car Types in Parking Lot')
plt.show()
5. Add Creativity & Interactivity
_______________thêm vài điểm nhấn và tính tương tác_______________________
Use colors creatively to convey different aspects of your data (e.g., hotter colors for larger values).
Try interactive elements if using a library like Plotly. For example, hovering over a bar could show additional information.
Interactive Chart Example (Plotly)
python
Copy code
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
data = {
    'Category': ['SUVs', 'Sedans', 'Trucks'],
    'Count': [15, 10, 5]
}

# Create interactive bar chart
fig = px.bar(data, x='Category', y='Count', color='Category',
             title='Car Types in Parking Lot')
fig.show()
6. Post Your Description
Write a brief description of the data you’re collecting and how you plan to visualize it.
Include your data categories and any interactive features you plan to implement.
7. Visualize and Share Your Results
'Avg Temperature (°C)': [24, 26, 22, 23, 27, 25, 21, 28, 26, 24],
    'Rainfall (mm)': [10, 5, 0, 7, 15, 2, 0, 20, 3, 12],
    'Wind Speed (km/h)': [15, 12, 20, 18, 10, 22, 25, 8, 16, 14]
}

# Creating a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plotting interactive line chart with Plotly
fig = px.line(df, x='Day', y=['Avg Temperature (°C)', 'Rainfall (mm)', 'Wind Speed (km/h)'], 
              title='Weather Data Comparison Over 10 Days')

# Show interactive plot
fig.show()
5. Next Steps






Collect Your Data: Decide the period and location for your weather data (you could get this from a weather API or from online weather history data).
Create Visualizations: Choose a visualization type (line, bar, or interactive plot) and write the code using your data.
Share the Results: Once you’re satisfied with the output, post your visualizations in your project discussion thread.
After collecting your data and creating your chart or infographic, share it with the class for feedback.

If you have a specific dataset or design in mind, let me know and I can help refine the code for your needs!

For a weather-related data visualization, you could compare metrics like average temperature, rainfall, and wind speed over a set period (e.g., days, weeks, or months). Since you're already working on a Weather Data Comparison for your DIY Data Visualization project, here’s how we can structure it.

Steps:
Collect Weather Data:

You can gather data from sources like online weather reports or APIs (OpenWeatherMap, for example).
For simplicity, let’s assume you're manually collecting the following data:
Average daily temperature (°C)
Total daily rainfall (mm)
Wind speed (km/h)
Organize Data: For this example, we’ll compare weather data across three categories (Temperature, Rainfall, Wind Speed) over 10 days.

Sample Weather Data:
Day	Avg Temperature (°C)	Rainfall (mm)	Wind Speed (km/h)
Day 1	24	10	15
Day 2	26	5	12
Day 3	22	0	20
Day 4	23	7	18
Day 5	27	15	10
Day 6	25	2	22
Day 7	21	0	25
Day 8	28	20	8
Day 9	26	3	16
Day 10	24	12	14
3. Visualizing the Data:
You can use Matplotlib to create bar charts or line charts that compare the data. Below is an example using the sample data:
_______________chatgpt sinh ra 2 ví dụ như phía dưới, để cho tương đồng với số ví dụ lấy ra ở trên đầu bài, thực ra thì chỉ dùng mục 1. này thôi_______________________
1. Line Chart for Weather Data
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
days = ['Day 1', 'Day 2', 'Day 3', 'Day 4', 'Day 5', 'Day 6', 'Day 7', 'Day 8', 'Day 9', 'Day 10']
temperature = [24, 26, 22, 23, 27, 25, 21, 28, 26, 24]
rainfall = [10, 5, 0, 7, 15, 2, 0, 20, 3, 12]
wind_speed = [15, 12, 20, 18, 10, 22, 25, 8, 16, 14]

# Plotting the data
plt.plot(days, temperature, label='Avg Temp (°C)', marker='o', color='r')
plt.plot(days, rainfall, label='Rainfall (mm)', marker='s', color='b')
plt.plot(days, wind_speed, label='Wind Speed (km/h)', marker='^', color='g')

# Adding labels and title
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('Weather Data Comparison Over 10 Days')
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
2. Bar Chart for Rainfall Comparison
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
days = ['Day 1', 'Day 2', 'Day 3', 'Day 4', 'Day 5', 'Day 6', 'Day 7', 'Day 8', 'Day 9', 'Day 10']
rainfall = [10, 5, 0, 7, 15, 2, 0, 20, 3, 12]

# Plotting bar chart
plt.bar(days, rainfall, color='blue')

# Adding labels and title
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Rainfall (mm)')
plt.title('Daily Rainfall Over 10 Days')

# Show the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
4. Enhancing with Interactivity (Using Plotly)
If you want to add interactive features like tooltips, Plotly is a great choice.
